A data story.
Once upon a time, some data was created by a random internet user and abandoned in a sea of unstructured data.
An algorithm passed by and decided to add xml tags to the text, and so it became semi-structured.
A data manager stumbled upon the data and thought it would be relevant for the database users, so she decided to add it to her relational database. 
So it became structured.
Then a cat walked over the data manager's keyboard.
The cat typed kjdsfacm;oi34dc.
The end?
I then thought to myself, "what if I could make this cat do something useful"?
So I asked the cat politely to finish all of my assignments for me and I sat in amazement watching the cat type away.
Later I received my mark of F- and decided that I need to reevaluate my life decisions. 
Yeah no, the cat was actually a witch and decaffeinated all the coffee on Earth.
The world's productivity plummeted.
No one really cared though, and now everyone spends all day picking mushrooms.
Of couse, trained mycologists check that they're safe for consumption.
In the end, this was for the best and everyone thanked the cat.
Ave cat.
The cat was rewarded with a lifetime supply of catnip.
The cat did not appreciate thanks, and wanted treats instead.
That is the end of the data story.
or is it? find out on the next episode of data cat!
Something shook up the data manager and he woke up with a shudder.
He just realized that he is back into the spaceship transported back from 'The Matrix'.
